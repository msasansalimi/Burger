# Node Express Handlebars Assignmet

### In this assignment I created burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM by following MVC design pattern.

#### Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

#### Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

####Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

####This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

#### I have deployed this assignment to Heroku. Visit deployed version [Here!](https://shielded-brushlands-57204.herokuapp.com/).
